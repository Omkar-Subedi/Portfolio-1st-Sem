            <header id="blogtext">16th November 2022, my first lecture at herald college
                Kathmandu.My bachelor level academic journey started from the mention date.
                We have total 4 modules to study in level 4,-1stsemester and my 1stsemesterâ€™s,
                1st week, 1stlecture was of Academic skills and teambased learning by Mr. 
                Manish Deuja. And other rest of three modules isFundamentals of computing, 
                Introductory to programming and problem solving, and last one is Web technology. 
                The first lecture wason LT-01 Wulfruna lecture hall. We meet up with friends and 
                went to lecture hall. Mr. Manish Deuja described about the module the description
                went very effective. Till now we had learnt total 3 module introduction,2 module 
                tutorials. The herald college has a unique style of teaching thatis LTW style of 
                teaching. L stands for lecture; T stands for tutorial and W stands for Workshop. 
                The college really impressed me in the sense of teaching in LTW method. In this 
                method we learn the same module in three steps 1st one is the lecture part and 
                after lecture the same module tutorial where we can discuss about the lecture 
                part and we can solve the confusion section. And last is the workshop. In workshop
                we implement what we had learnt in lecture and tutorial section.
